An explanation of the what the app does and how it works, the approach taken in building it, and any unsolved problems that you hit.
 Honestly did had a students/teachers many to many then applied to a scope thought process to posts/comments for users.
 User stories written for your app.
    Once upon a time, I planned to have a students/teachers tables to intergrate in a fun interactive way. Came to though in thought of scope had to minimize the of errors to be accomplished. Taking smaller steps decided to go for a posts to comments such as a blog.
    This is what I had came up.
    I had not completed my api for ttt but by this I hope to complete both projects.

    SCSS was used in the beginning of the project for "btn" buttons input. Used Materialize for the styles of the HTML.
